rucsi Booking
============
The project consists of two pages, and is built using `Bootstrap` and `Backbone`.

 Booking (Page 1)
-
Quite often clients will phone into a restaurant and a customer’s booking need to be captured into the system.  This should be a simple page that allows a user to capture the details of a diner. The state when updating of the booking page is stored in `LocalStorage`.
The diners details might include fields such as:

 * First Name
 * Last Name
 * Dining Date
 * Number of Covers (How many people?)
 * Phone Number
 * Email

Seating (Page 2)
-
At the reception desk of a restaurant, the concierge will look at a list of diners and mark them as seated. This page should pull in data that you captured in Booking. The page should allow the concierge to mark a diner at two stages:

 * Not arrived
 * Seated
